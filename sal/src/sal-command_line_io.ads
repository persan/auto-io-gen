--  Abstract:
--
--  Provide generic routines for reading parameters from the command line.
--
--  Each Get_* procedure reads a particular parameter type from
--  Command_Line.Argument(Next_Arg) and then increments Next_Arg by
--  one. PARAMETER_ERROR is raised for *any* error, after putting an
--  appropriate message to Standard_Error.
